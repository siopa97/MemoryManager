We made the assumption that the memory will have a max capacity of 5,000kb, and the randomly generated processes can have a size anywhere from 100 kb to 600kb. The memory can also only hold up to 10 processes and will not take anymore until one is removed from memory, or if memory is at the full 5,000kb it will not take anymore processes. Compaction is done by the user whenever they feel that it is necessary. There is also an option to print out the contents in memory even though it already prints out the memory each time a change is made. In order to run this program go into the project folder and click on the launcher file it should open the project in command line.
